## Explanation:
After transcribing the audio, send_to_api_and_display_usdz is called with the transcribed text.
This function makes a POST request to the specified API endpoint, sending the transcribed text as data.
Upon receiving a successful response, it extracts the USDZ file URL from the response and displays it as a downloadable link in the Streamlit app.
Error handling: It checks for a successful response status and informs the user if the retrieval fails.
## Important Notes:
Adjust the data payload according to the API's expected request format. The example assumes a simple structure where the transcribed text is sent directly, but your API might require a different format.
The API's response structure and how you extract the USDZ URL might vary. Modify the usdz_url = response.json().get('usdz_url') line based on the actual response structure from your API.
Ensure you handle API keys securely. Hardcoding them in your source code, as shown for simplicity, is not recommended for production applications. Consider using environment variables or other secure methods for storing and accessing sensitive keys.
